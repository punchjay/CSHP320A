Create a new WPF Project with a TextBox that only accepts:

    US Zip Codes ##### or #####-####
    Canadian Postal Codes: A#B#C#

The window contains a Submit button that is only enabled when a valid zip code or postal code is entered.

So for example, a user could enter 98122 or 98012-4444 or T1R2X4 and the Submit button would be enabled.

The Submit button does not need to perform any action.

Hint: Keep things simple and use a TextBox and an event on the TextBox.

Hint: Don't use User Controls and don't use XAML binding. It's a lot of work.
